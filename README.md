### Live @ http://mandbinsurance-env.eba-qbzfhkdt.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
#### Overview
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict fraudulent claims in the insurance industry. The aim is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify potential fraudulent activities, thereby enabling the company to take necessary actions to mitigate risks and losses.

#### Project Scope
The project encompasses the following key aspects:

#### Data Collection: 
Gathering relevant data related to insurance claims, including historical claim records, customer information, policy details, etc.

#### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility with machine learning algorithms. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducting comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, anomalies, and patterns. This step is crucial for identifying potential features and understanding the underlying dynamics of fraudulent claims.

#### Feature Engineering: 
Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. Feature engineering plays a vital role in extracting meaningful information from raw data and improving the model's performance.

#### Model Development: 
Building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting will be explored and evaluated to identify the most suitable model for the task.

#### Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This step involves fine-tuning the models and selecting the best-performing one for deployment.

#### Live Prediction: 
Implementing the final model into a live prediction system where new insurance claims can be processed in real-time. This system will provide instant feedback on the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent, enabling timely intervention and decision-making by the company.
